# What is gelato?

Think of your gelato bot as enabling you to use `If This, Then That` for smart contracts. It allows for the combination of arbitrary conditions with arbitrary actions on-chain.

Developers, you can use gelato to build out cool end-user products, such as limit orders on DEXs or automated interest rate refinancing using multiple lending protocols.

# What does this repo contain?

It contains the gelato protocol, condition and action smart contracts and uses @nomiclabs/buidler and ethers.js.

# Want to build a condition and action on top of gelato?

We will create a documentation for our protocol soon, stay tuned!
